It could provide new depths of consumer insight. It allowed consumers to recieve more targeted information and less mass market rubbish and it would allow for products better suited to the needs of consumers. Some went so far as to call it “objective” and “all knowing”.

"Why is developing new products so difficult?","https://blog.markgrowth.com/why-is-developing-new-products-so-difficult-b9de589486eb?source=user_profile---------4----------------","Every year, thousands of new products are released globally. Whether released by huge global firms such as Amazon or by small, innovative startups, only a few of these products ever “make it”. In fact, we can approximate with the Pareto principle that roughly 80% of the sales from new products will come from only 20% of the causes.","Jan 11"
